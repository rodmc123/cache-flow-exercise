# Invoice App

To start the app just run it from intellij or whatever IDE you are using

Should start by default at localhost:8080

This project is using an in memory H2 database
you can check the H2 DB console from the browser
http://localhost:8080/h2-console 
* **Url**: jdbc:h2:file:~/data/mydb
* **user**: sa
* **password**: password

To test the API's you can use Postman or a similar app...

* Tables to keep history of changes are generated by Envers, you'll see them in the H2 console with name <table-name>_AUD
didn't add a controller to retrieve the list of events but the data is there. 
* No energy for unit tests lol
* Also didn't add logs to the code but there are some comments.
